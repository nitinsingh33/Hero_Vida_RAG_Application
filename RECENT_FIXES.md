# 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved:

### ✅ **Fix 1: Gemini Model Error**
**Problem:** `404 models/gemini-pro is not found`
**Root Cause:** Google deprecated `gemini-pro` model name
**Solution:** Updated model name from `gemini-pro` to `gemini-1.5-flash`
**File Changed:** `backend/services/gemini_service.py`

### ✅ **Fix 2: File Size Limit Increase**
**Problem:** 10MB limit was too small for larger documents
**Request:** Increase to 30MB
**Solution:** Updated file size limit from 10MB (10485760 bytes) to 30MB (31457280 bytes)
**Files Changed:** 
- `backend/.env`
- `backend/.env.example`  
- `frontend/src/components/FileUpload.js`

### ✅ **Fix 3: Frontend Webpack Issue**
**Problem:** React dev server configuration error
**Solution:** 
- Added `.env` file to frontend with webpack configurations
- Updated `react-scripts` to latest version
- Added `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true` to bypass configuration checks
